      source --THISDIRECTORY--/bin/with +
      coqide
      ... or other coq commands ...

To run it from a directory other than this one, prefix the path
of this directory to "bin".

To install the software permanently, add this to your .profile:

      source --THISDIRECTORY--/bin/with +

Then "with" can be run, unprefixed by a path, as well as the coq programs.

To use another version of coq, try one of these

      source with coqtrunk
      source with coq84

To see what other packages are available, try

      with

To set up emacs so ProofGeneral will be active automatically, add

   (load-file "--THISDIRECTORY--/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.d/pg-init.el")

to your ~/.emacs file.
